## Description

**[HouseHop](https://house-hop-fdf44d2c76d6.herokuapp.com/)** is an app designed to help homebuyers organize their home-hunting journey. Built using **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, and **Node.js**, it offers two key features: **Planner** and **Wishlist**.

* **Planner**: In the Planner, users can add houses they plan to visit and take notes on those theyâ€™ve already seen.

* **Wishlist**: The Wishlist page allows users to view their saved houses, categorized by properties with a rating of 4+, houses under budget, and those that meet both criteriaâ€”rated 4+ and under budget.

## Motivation

Some of my friends recently bought homes and had a hard time keeping track of all the properties they visited, along with the pros and cons of each.

This inspired me to build an app that streamlines the home-buying processâ€”one that I could also use for my own future home-buying adventure, once the housing market stabilizes, interest rates come down, and I have a job to pay the mortgage. ðŸ˜‰
